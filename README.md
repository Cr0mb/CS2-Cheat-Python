```plaintext
# V3.0
# Changed aimbot to external mouse movement instead of writing view angles.
# Added no flash and spectator list
# Added armor bar and armor esp
````

```plaintext
# V2.7
# Added weapon esp
# Moved weapon check directly into aimbot.py
# Added bomb esp
```

```plaintext
# V2.6
# Added fov overlay color changed
# Added simple weapon check for aimbot (no aim on knife/nade)
# Aim at closest bone to crosshair added to aimbot
```

```plaintext
# V2.5
# Complete GUI Overhaul
# Custom Color window
# Added configs
# Added RCS Control toggle
# Added Render Refresh Rate Sync Toggle
# Added triggerbot always on
```

```plaintext
# V2.4
# The aimbot learns from the differences between the angles it actually moves to and what it intended to move to, based on your mouse movements during aiming.
# It stores these small delta angle adjustments linked to quantized angles in a dictionary (learning_data), which it saves to a JSON file so it can improve over time
# across sessions.

# Velocity Prediction:
# To improve aiming accuracy, the target's current velocity is read and used to predict
# where the target will be shortly (ahead by a small prediction time). This predicted position
# compensates for target movement, allowing the aimbot to lead shots instead of aiming at
# the target's current location, increasing hit probability especially on moving targets.
```

V2.3

<!> UPDATED FEATURES <!> 7/6/2025

- Separated script into modules further.

- Added aimbot & recoil control with extensive customization options.

- Added Glow ESP.

- Added cooldown feature to TriggerBot.

- Added BHop functionality (works very well).

- Added show FOV overlay for aimbot (separate overlay window).

- Added process handler support for client.dll.

- Added hardcoded offsets (can be updated using update_offsets.py).

- Added aimbot toggle bone; due to messed up bone indices, added downward_offset instead of fixing (kek).

- Made offsets load locally instead of fetching from a2x's CS2 Dumper.

- All features are completely customizable in pyqt5 gui.

- Removed initial weapon check from b2.3 (broken after update?)
```

## üîß Version 2.2

> üóìÔ∏è **Updated:** 7/3/2025

```markdown
- Separated offsets into their own dedicated script/module for cleaner structure.

- Created a Legit Aimbot with recoil control system.
  * Logic contained in its own separate script for modularity.

- Modularized the project:
  * Scripts are now separated by function (e.g., `GHax.py`, `Aim_Recoil.py`).
  * Improves code organization and readability.

- Current structure requires `GHax.py` and `Aim_Recoil.py` to be run separately.
  * Full multiprocessing integration coming in Version 2.3.
```

## üîß Version 2.1

> üóìÔ∏è **Updated:** 7/2/2025

```markdown
- Replaced separate "CT Side Only" and "T Side Only" ESP toggles with a unified team check logic:
  * "Enemy Only" shows ESP only for opposing team members.
  * "Team Only" shows ESP only for teammates.

- Fixed issue where the watermark would disappear when looking in certain directions.
  * Root cause: `pw_module.end_drawing()` was conditionally called inside the ESP loop,
    causing it to be skipped if no entities were drawn (e.g., looking at empty space).

- Refactored `WallHack.Render()` to call `pw_module.end_drawing()` exactly once,
  after processing all entities, ensuring proper rendering lifecycle every frame.

- This fix prevents visual glitches like the watermark vanishing or incomplete overlays
  when no entities are visible.

- Added FOV changer slider to GUI (default value: 90).
- Added disclaimer informing that FOV changes write directly to game memory.
- Slider updates the FOV value in real-time during gameplay.
